# opentelemetry-c-demo

Simple ZeroMQ client, proxy and server application traced using [opentelemetry-c](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/opentelemetry-c). Clients ask servers to compute the nth prime number (n is the request input). Requests and responses are routed through a central proxy.

## Architecture

The picture below shows how hosts are connected through ZeroMQ sockets. Arrows represent how messages flow.

![Replayer Architecture](architecture.png)

### The proxy

The proxy binds 4 sockets on ports 5559, 5560, 5561 and 5562. Make sure those ports are available before running applications.

- A pair of ROUTER and DEALER sockets to exchange messages (requests and responses) between frontend and backends. Read more on this combination in the [ZMQ Guide](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#Shared-Queue-DEALER-and-ROUTER-sockets).
- A ROUTER socket receiving clients' connection and disconnection messages. These sockets help track the number of clients connected. When a client connects to the proxy, it sends a message saying "CONNECT". And "DISCONNECT" when he is done.
- A PUB socket sends a message ("KILL") whenever the proxy wants to shut down. This helps all subscribers to gracefully exit.

### Client

In the previous picture, 2 host clients are shown. This number could be infinite. Each client connects to two sockets:

- A REQ socket is connected to one of the proxy ROUTER socket to send requests and receive responses.
- A DEALER socket connected to the other proxy ROUTER socket to send client "CONNECT" and "DISCONNECT" messages.

### Server

In the previous picture, 2 host clients are shown. Each host has 2 workers threads. These numbers could be infinite too.

Each server connects/binds to three sockets:

- A ROUTER socket is connected to the Proxy DEALER socket, to send requests and receive responses from workers.
- A SUB socket is connected to the Proxy PUB socket to be notified when the proxy stops.
- A DEALER socket is binded with Workers, to forward requests/replies to workers.

### Worker

The worker is the one in charge of handling the client's requests.

Each worker connects to two sockets:

- A REP socket to connect to the Server DEALER socket, to receive requests and send responses to the server.
- A SUB socket is connected to the Proxy PUB socket to be notified when the proxy stops.

## Run

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dorsal-lab/opentelemetry-c-demo.git
$ cd opentelemetry-c-demo
$ docker compose up
```

This command will launch 3 clients, 1 proxy and 2 servers on different hosts. Each client will send 10 requests to the server and shut down. After all clients shutdowns, the proxy will shut down and finally the server also.

Each host logs and traces are mounted to the `out/` directory. Here will be the folder structure :

To view and analyze CTF traces, you can use the [otel-replayer project](https://github.com/dorsal-lab/otel-replayer) to send each host's telemetry data to observability backends like Jaeger and Prometheus.
